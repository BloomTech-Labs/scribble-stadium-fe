## Project Overview

Welcome to the Single Player Mode!

This is a new feature where the user will be able to now choose to play in a Single Player Mode!

**_User Flow_**

- Player accepts the mission!
- Player completes the read part of the mission
- Player uploads at least one of the draw or write portions of the game or both
- Player will be matched with a bot player
- Player will be able to vote for his/her favorite story and/or drawing (slider voting and max 5 emojis)
- Player can either continue to the next level or return to see the results

**_Single Player Mode_**

Similar to “binge-watching,” a user should be able to approximate a week’s worth of gameplay by reading/draw/write phases and then do point share and go through the matchup mechanics using dummy data taken from previous submissions under bot players without chron jobs.

**_The Why_**

This mode is perfect for an on-demand experience where there is no pressure to be part of a team and he/she can experience the game before they attempt a team mode experience

## Current State of Project:
